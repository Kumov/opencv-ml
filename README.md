# opencv-ml
Simple machine learning, mainly SVM using opencv-ml

## Prepare Mnist Dataset
The mnist dataset is a handwritten digit dataset collected by Yann Lecun. The dataset for python programmer is available as pickle file via the website http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/gettingstarted.html, but one can either access the original binary dataset from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ or recover the pickle file back to jpg images using scripts we provide.

## Training & Testing Mnist Dataset by SVM
